# Football Team & Match Management System

The system will be used to manage football teams, players, and their upcoming matches. The system provides a platform for administrators, managers, and coaches to form teams, register players, organize matches, and keep track of results. It also allows fans, players, and staff to view schedules, team details, and match results. The system should be accessible to registered teams, players, and authorized staff.

## The system must
•⁠  ⁠Allow administrators and coaches to add, modify, and delete teams and players, including data such as player name, position, age, nationality, stats, and team.
•⁠  ⁠Enable administrators to schedule matches, e.g., date, time, venue, opposing teams, and referees.
•⁠  ⁠Allow teams to register for leagues or tournaments, validating eligibility requirements (e.g., squad size, age limits for players).
•⁠  ⁠Allow referees or officials to input match results and player statistics (e.g., goals, assists, cards).

## Non-functional requirements
•⁠  ⁠Handle a high volume of concurrent users, especially on match days.
•⁠  ⁠Securely store player, team, and match data.
•⁠  ⁠Provide multiple levels of access for players, coaches, referees, administrators, and spectators.
•⁠  ⁠Fast response time for live score updates and timetables.
•⁠  ⁠High availability with minimal downtime during competitions.

## User Interface
The user interface should be intuitive and simple to use for coaches, players, referees, administrators, and spectators. Provide fast access to live scores, rankings, fixtures, and rosters.
